                                            If you want more search traffic to your Shopify site, then you have come to the right place. Make a cup of coffee and by the end of your drink, you will be fully confident about your potentiality in Shopify SEO.
                                            <br /><br />

                                            The popularity of ecommerce and selling on Shopify is bigger than ever. More and more websites are coming online and taking over all the social media platforms with their presence.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            As your niche becomes more competitive, it will be harder and harder to sustain growth.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            That’s the problem Joseph Richardson was facing when he posted on a Facebook group for recommendations to get his home page ranking for his primary niche keyword.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            This is where we found him “desperately” looking for a savior; as he is struggling for almost a year with stagnant sells although his Shopify website is much better than many of the vendors.

                                            Joseph runs the UK ecommerce site, Hollywood Mirrors, and was trying to rank for some <strong><i>competitive</i></strong> niche terms without doing any SEO. In this competitive market, it is like an injustice to deprive your site of SEO. Never do this “crime”.

                                            <br />

                                            As you can see, his main keyword is very competitive and kinda impossible to rank without SEO and is even very hard with SEO.

                                            When we formally reached him, he told us his woes. At first, he was getting considerable traffic, but, the rankings and growth on his Shopify site had been flat for over 18 months. We could tell that he was really frustrated at his lack of results and at the brink of quitting Shopify for good. He also told us that he had hired several SEO consultants, but no one could make any progress and that’s why he was desperately looking for a solution in forums.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            This convinced us to help this person in need. We started our initial auditing and found many things that we need to work on. Although his site was supervised by other SEO agencies, we found many black holes that were leaking many important factors. SEO is never an easy thing to do and Shopify SEO is rather a harder nut to crack. But, we were determined to help him as we like to work on cases that are competitive and can stretch our boundaries.

                                                His Shopify site looked good – so what was the problem?

                                            He had a beautifully designed website, featured in the media logos and amazing high-quality product photos.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            He had seemingly been doing everything right on the outside. When his search engine rankings began to get stagnant, he thought about more links and backlinks.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            In fact, it is a common practice among business and store owners to think that adding links can overcome the scarcity of search they are getting. But focusing on links for the sake of boosting your referring domains or domain authority can sometimes do more harm than good. Why, because you need to focus on the relevant links to determine how your website can better match searcher intent. You need to make sure that you’re optimizing the right pages on your site for the right terms.

                                            I once had a client that wanted to have their product page rank #1 for the keyword phrase “best shampoo for dogs.” All of the results for this keyword phrase were blog posts – this wasn’t the right term for a product page.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            Similarly, when looking at Joseph’s site, I noticed that the top ranking pages for the term “Hollywood Mirrors” were typically category pages. Joseph wanted his homepage to rank for that term – but how was he going to do it? He’d spent time and money trying to figure this out.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            When I analyzed the SERP related to this term, I did notice that there was one other homepage in the results. So I said, “Let’s go for it.” He wanted to do it, and there was a chance for us to rank because other home pages were also ranking.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            After my quick call with Joseph, we were able to uncover some SEO techniques he could use to improve the ranking of his Shopify site, and it worked!

                                            <br /><br />

                                            <br /><br />

                                            Our solution didn’t include any link building, black hat tactics, or magic ponies. The trick – and it isn’t even really a trick – is to optimize your site so that it makes sense for search engines and your customers. Optimization is the way to make any site better for both search engines like Google and the customers that are visiting your website or Shopify store.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            Joseph isn’t the first client that we’ve helped to dramatically improve ranking with primary optimizations like content and on-site SEO. In fact, we’ve been doing this for many years, and I’ve even helped ecommerce sites outrank Amazon and huge brands in the organic listings.

                                            Ahrefs ranking screenshots are sexy. They show precisely how the traffic is interacting all the time. We found that the increase in ranking virtually doubled his traffic.

Google’s goal is to find and rank content that the mass people are looking after (that includes you and me). How users interact and engage with every different niche and the page content before returning to SERP, determines how Google will make a SERP. Yes, even dumb searches are important for ranking in such places.

                                            Below is a simple demographic on how it usually works. See user queries and searches about anything is the main factor to make any ranking. Google being a bot, needs to rely on the human search for their SERP. So, whatever your site is, you always need to look for the best matching between your product and Googles preference.

                                            When you are organizing your keywords, products and categories for your Shopify site, think about how this information can be organized and presented to users.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            Website architecture is a fancy way of saying, “How is your site content organized?” The site structure not only ensures that users have an intuitive experience on your online store, but it also helps search engines make sense of your site, too.

                                            <br /><br />

                                            <strong>
                                                There a few different page types on your Shopify store, but they can be broken down into five main categories:
                                            </strong>

                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Homepage</li>
                                                <li>Informational pages (About, Contact, etc.)</li>
                                                <li>Category/Collection pages</li>
                                                <li>Product pages</li>
                                                <li>Blog posts</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br /><br />

                                            So you want to think about it in terms of clicks. Ideally, a user on your Shopify site should be able to find what they’re looking for in three clicks or less. This isn’t always possible – especially if you have a large number of products and sub-categories – but it’s something to aim for.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            As far as site structure goes, though, you do sometimes have to strike a balance between what works for SEO and what works for the user experience. For SEO, you want to try to maintain that three-click rule. Usability may dictate needing sub-categorization a bit deeper than that – so that users can find what they’re looking for more easily based on category.

                                                How I Ranked Joseph’s Shopify Site

                                            <br />
                                            Luckily for Joseph we didn’t need much tools (as his site was already very neat) to get him to #1.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            With all of this SEO information in mind, you just need to remember that optimizing a page on your store can be broken down into two parts: optimizing the content and optimizing the HTML. We used our experise in order to do this. These are some of the steps and considerations I went through while working with Joseph and Hollywood Mirrors.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <div className="h3">
                                                Keyword optimization- the first rule of SEO
                                            </div>
                                            <br /> 
                                            It seems simple, right? You just put your keywords in the important places.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            But where are those important places, exactly? And what keywords are you talking about?
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Everyone talks about the title tag, H1, headings, and primary keywords – but you need to focus on more than that. There are other signal areas to put important terms, and you also need to look at secondary keywords and LSI/NLP terms, as well.

                                            <br /><br />
                                            <div className="study-img w-75 m-auto">
                                                <img src="/assets/img/case-study/Where-To-Put-Keywords.webp" alt="" width="100%" />

                                            <br /><br />

                                            While your titles and H1s may be in the most important group, there are many other areas on the site to consider. You have to think about the types of keywords and terms you’re putting in secondary areas – like those in groups B, C, and D. Some may be more important than others, but they’re all important. Some factors may work better than other. We will never know until we apply everything and check which is doing the best optimization.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <strong>
                                                It’s all about visualizing the signal areas on your site. What do you want people to see?
                                            </strong>

                                            <br /><br />
                                            <div className="study-img w-75 m-auto">

                                            <br /><br />

                                            In fact, in our experience, one of the most important signal areas of Shopify collection pages is having keywords or key terms used in anchor text. Why is that, exactly? You have to think of Google like a robot.

                                            <br /><br />
                                            <div className="study-img w-75 m-auto">

                                            </div>
                                            <br /><br />

                                            What makes sense for a robot? When Google looks at a product intent search, it will compare how many products a page links to. With that in mind, it stands to reason that the number of links and the relevant keywords included in those links act as a strong signal to Google when it comes to determining which page will best satisfy user intent.

                                                Optimizing the content
                                            </div>
                                            <br /><br />
                                            When it comes to optimizing the content on the pages of your Shopify store, people usually make the grievous mistake of stuffing keywords in every other lines of their pages. Generally speaking, Google expects to see certain words on the page for a given search.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            User experience still comes into play when considering the content and keyword density on the pages of your site. Google tends to heavily weight user experience metrics, so you want to make sure that the content on each of your pages answers the questions that people are asking. This way, they’re more likely to stay on the page, engage with the content, and make a purchase.
                                            <br /><br />

                                            <br /><br />
                                            The words you use around your primary and secondary keyword phrases actually help search engines know what the page is about. LSI stands for Latent Semantic Indexing – and it’s not as complicated as it sounds. LSI keywords are simply words or phrases that are related to one another semantically. They’re just keywords that are commonly found together.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            These terms help Google put the content of your page into context so that it knows exactly what you’re talking about. More relevancy in your topic and more information on your product will always let Google to make a bet on your site.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            There are tools that you can use to help figure out exactly how to use your keyword terms in the content on your site. We took help from several to make a estimation. That helped us to able to rank a page higher by including some of the right terms in the right places in the right context. With difficult or competitive keywords, you really have to pay attention to context – because, let’s face it, SEO ain’t easy.

                                            SEO is really about optimization on every end. That includes the usability of your site- generally known as “User-Interaction” or UI Search engines look at a site and make sure that they’re sending users to pages that are relevant to their queries like every guardian should! This doesn’t mean a high-end design but a fresh and optimized one where people can find everything at ease

                                            When I was talking with Joseph about his Hollywood Mirrors Shopify site, I noticed that he had some important terms in span tags and in images.

                                            <br /><br />
                                            <div className="study-img w-75 m-auto">
                                                <img src="/assets/img/case-study/Darren-DeMatas-Personal-Meeting-Room-Zoom-1024x418.png" alt="" width="100%" />
                                            </div>
                                            <br /><br />

                                            The site may seem pretty but we found a flow that was outright punishable if there were any SEO police around. We found that his main keyword was in the slider image of his homepage. He’s already trying to go after some really competitive keyword terms, and they need to be in logical places on the page – not in images.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <strong>His main keyword was in an image, not in his H1.</strong>

                                            <br /><br />
                                            Making this one change made a substantial boost on his ranking issues.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Engaging “Call to action” buttons can also help boost your site. Joseph offers next day delivery at Hollywood Mirrors, but that wasn’t mentioned anywhere on the homepage. This is an important NLP keyword that we added to improve his site’s user experience and content optimization.

                                            Money, the ultimate result everyone wants to achieve after an optimization. Shopify being a completely different ball game, we needed our work payed dividend- by improved sells and income across the market in next months.

                                            If you rely on Shopify analytics and reporting to gain insights on keywords and organic traffic, you’ll miss out on some important data and insights. Google Analytics is the place to go to see the impact of SEO on revenue.

                                            The problem with Shopify is you can’t get detailed keyword reporting like you can on Google Analytics or Google Search Console. I like to zero-in on specific search terms when looking at keyword value.
